#write a method that takes an array of numbers
#and returns an array with the same number of elements
#and each element has the running total from og array

# Examples:
# running_total([2, 5, 13]) == [2, 7, 20]
# running_total([14, 11, 7, 15, 20]) == [14, 25, 32, 47, 67]
# running_total([3]) == [3]
# running_total([]) == []

def running_total(array)
  sum = 0
  array.map do |x|
    sum += x
  end
end

puts running_total([2, 5, 13]) == [2, 7, 20]
puts running_total([14, 11, 7, 15, 20]) == [14, 25, 32, 47, 67]
puts running_total([3]) == [3]
puts running_total([]) == []
